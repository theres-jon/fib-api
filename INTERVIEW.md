# Platform Engineering Interview Project

Hi there! Thanks so much for participating in our interview process. Your mission--should you choose to accept it--is to write a web application that generates Fibonacci numbers based on user input.  The idea is that you build a production-ready application that will be maintained for the next several years, and can run on a multitude of cloud environments.

The basic web server code has been done for you, minus the Fibonacci logic. Keep in mind that the actual coding part (Fibonacci numbers) is simple because it's not just about the *code*, but rather the whole *package*. Treat this as if this is getting released into production with your name on it.

**Tip: Don't let *perfect* be the enemy of *good enough*!**

## Submitting

You should create a Git repository and submit your project as a tarball/zip of the repository (or invite to your private code repository).

## Expectations

1. Edit either `go/main.go` or `python/main.py` and complete the respective Fibonacci-generating function.
2. Add in any supporting modules, functions, files, scripts, configs, docs, etc, that help meet your definition of "production ready".

## Things To Think About

Some of these questions may be asked of you in the follow-up:

- Is the output correct? How do you verify?
- How do you ensure changes don't break the application?
- How might the application scale?
- How can this application be deployed?
- What if the application goes down? How will you know?

## Timeframe
This project should be submitted within 24 hours. Please try not to spend more than a few hours on it.

## Bottom Line
**We don't expect every submission to be perfect.** That's okay! The idea is that you write clean, testable code, and that your project shows consideration for the runtime, lifecycle, and maintenance of your application within the platforms where they would be hosted. After all, we aren't feature developers, we are more focused on building bridges and applying the glue to promote best practices and efficiency.
